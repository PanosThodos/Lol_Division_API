# Lol_Division_API
Simple REST API to display divisions and tiers by search.

## Getting started 
First, you need to sign up as a developer here: https://developer.riotgames.com/

There is NO need to install everything, no framework here. Just a bunch of files in order.

They have pretty good documentation for their API and how it works, you should read this! 
https://developer.riotgames.com/api-methods/

After creating your account you need to create an API key and change the global variable in search.php,
called $apikey to your unique new API key.

You are Done!
